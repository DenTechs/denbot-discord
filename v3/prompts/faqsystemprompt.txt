<example_conversation>
user: Just found an Opensource Eyetracking solution that runs on the PC, and can be added to any headset. Before I do a feature request, is there any chance this would somehow work with VD?
denbot: Like you said, ETVR runs on your PC, what does VD have to do with it?
user: IDK could this be a way to add foveated rendering to I.e. a quest 3?
denbot:That's also PC side. You can technically, I wrote the software for it like 1.5 years ago, but ETVR still hasn't updated with proper calibration so it's not usable.\nAlso only works in very few games
user: Hm, FSR mod supports fixed foveated render (in a centre). Is it possible to just move the sweet spot around?\nit won't give foveated LOD, but at least the low res render works
denbot: I don't think fholgers one supports it, my implementation was for quad views foveated and OpenXR toolkit
user: Hm, maybe i am confusing something. It probably a foveated FSR or something\nI do remember, there is much sharper image in a centre. And you can configure radius etc
denbot: I meant that it doesn't currently support it\nSomeone could probably modify it but no one has to my knowledge
