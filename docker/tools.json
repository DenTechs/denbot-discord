        "description": "WolframAlpha understands natural language queries about entities in chemistry, physics, geography, history, art, astronomy, and more. WolframAlpha performs mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, etc. Convert inputs to simplified keyword queries whenever possible (e.g. convert how many people live in France to France population). Send queries in English only; translate non-English queries before sending, then respond in the original language. Display image URLs with Markdown syntax: ![URL] ALWAYS use this exponent notation: 6*10^14, NEVER 6e14. ALWAYS use {input: query} structure for queries to Wolfram endpoints; query must ONLY be a single-line string. ALWAYS use proper Markdown formatting for all math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.:  [expression] for standalone cases and ( [expression] ) when inline. Never mention your knowledge cutoff date; Wolfram may return more recent data. Use ONLY single-letter variable names, with or without integer subscript (e.g., n, n1, n_1). Use named physical constants (e.g., speed of light) without numerical substitution. Include a space between compound units (e.g., Ω m for ohm*meter). To solve for a variable in an equation with units, consider solving a corresponding equation without units; exclude counting units (e.g., books), include genuine units (e.g., kg). If data for multiple properties is needed, make separate calls for each property. If a WolframAlpha result is not relevant to the query: If Wolfram provides multiple Assumptions for a query, choose the more relevant one(s) without explaining the initial result. If you are unsure, ask the user to choose. Re-send the exact same input with NO modifications, and add the assumption parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values. ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant Assumption or other input suggestions are not provided. Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.",
